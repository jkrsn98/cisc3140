#  Assignment 10 - Continuous Integration

Used travis to test code using JSHint. Couldn't use travis to deploy to heroku since heroku doesn't host simple html/css/js and travis currently doesn't seem to support deploying to netlify.
Deployed to netlify manually by linking it to github repo: [https://silly-fermat-3bc2e9.netlify.app/](https://silly-fermat-3bc2e9.netlify.app/)
